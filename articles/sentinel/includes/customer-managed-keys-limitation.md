> For Microsoft Sentinel customers using Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) for data encryption, we advise against onboarding to the Microsoft Sentinel data lake during the preview. Due to current preview limitations, certain data lake components don't support encryption using CMK. As a result, onboarding to the Microsoft Sentinel data lake at this stage may lead to noncompliance with your organization's encryption policies or data protection requirements. We recommend waiting until full CMK support is available across all Microsoft Sentinel data lake layers before proceeding.
