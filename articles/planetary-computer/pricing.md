# Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro pricing

Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You're charged for the resources you consume, providing flexibility and control over your spending. This article details the pricing for the different components of the service.

## Billing Meters

Usage of the service is measured with the following dimensions (no pricing values are shown in this document):

| Meter                       | Measured Units            | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Capacity**               | GiB-month                  | Ingested data stored after any cloud optimization and compression.                                         |
| **Operations**             | 10K operations            | Storage read / metadata retrieval operations (search, list, item/asset metadata access).                   |
| **Ingestion & Transformation** | vCPU-hour                 | Compute consumed transforming data into cloud-optimized formats (for example COG generation).              |
| **Bandwidth**              | GiB egress                 | Data transferred out of the Azure region hosting the GeoCatalog resource.                                  |

All meters are calculated using binary gigabytes (GiB), where 1 GiB equals 1,073,741,824 bytes. 

### Capacity

Measured in GiB-month of data stored in your GeoCatalog (original plus derived / optimized forms). Includes any cloud-optimized representations generated by the platform.

### Operations

Operations are read operations for data that is stored in managed storage. Common patterns include:
* Use the SAS API to read stored data
* Use the Data API to create a tile based on stored data

Use of the [STAC API](./stac-overview.md) for querying or searching a catalog isn't considered a read operation. 


### Ingestion & Transformation

Measured in vCPU-hours consumed while ingesting and transforming source data (including optimization to formats such as COGs). Consumption varies with data volume and the format of the data. 

To help estimate what an ingestion operation could cost in vCPU hours, here are some benchmarks:
 
| Data Type | Format State | Description (Format / Bands) | Representative vCPU/GiB |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Sentinel‑2 L2A](./data-visualization-samples.md#sentinel-2-l2a-collection-configuration) | Non-COG | GeoTIFF; 13 MSI spectral bands (B1–B12 incl. B8A, 10–60 m) plus QA masks | 0.50 |
| Micro COG 1000 | COG | Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (1000 2-10 MB files); Three bands (RGB) | 0.423 |
| Aerial Orthomosaic | Non-COG | Orthorectified GeoTIFF mosaic; Three bands (RGB); large tiles | 0.20 |
| [National Aerial Imagery Program](./data-visualization-samples.md#the-national-agriculture-imagery-program-collection-configuration) | COG | Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF; Four bands (RGB + NIR) | 0.030 |

To estimate your vCPU-hours, select a data type that is similar to the one you plan on ingesting, and multiply the  **Representative vCPU/GiB**  value by the number of gigabytes of data you intend to ingest. 

### Bandwidth

Measured in GiB egress when data leaves the Azure region of the GeoCatalog resource. Egress occurs concurrently with read [operations](#operations) when data leaves a GeoCatalog resource and goes to a different Azure Region or to the internet. 

## Cost management

Azure provides tools to help you monitor and manage your spending. You can use [Microsoft Cost Management and Billing](/azure/cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview) to track your Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro usage and costs, set budgets, and receive alerts.
