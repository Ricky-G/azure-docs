# US Core

The HL7 US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG) is a set of rules and best practices that help healthcare providers share patient information safely and efficiently across the United States. The Azure Health Data Services FHIR server supports the following US Core versions:

- [US Core 3.1.1](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/index.html)
- [US Core 6.1.0](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ImplementationGuide-hl7.fhir.us.core.html)

Note that the FHIR service doesn't store any profiles from implementation guides by default. You'll need to load them into the FHIR service. Follow [storing profiles instructions](./fhir/store-profiles-in-fhir.md) to store the relevant profiles for your desired US Core version. 

## US Core 6.1.0
## `$docref` operation
The [$docref operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/OperationDefinition-docref.html), as defined as part of US Core 6.1.0, is used to return all the references to documents related to a patient. A `searchset` Bundle containing DocumentReference resources for the patient is returned. 

### `$docref` parameters
|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|patient|The ID of the patient resource.|
|start|The start date-time of the date range relates to care dates, not record currency dates. |
|end| The end date-time of the date range relates to care dates, not record currency dates. |
|type| The type relates to document type.|

Note that on-demand and profile parameters aren't currently supported.

### Example `$docref` requests

**Request the latest CCD for a patient using GET syntax**

```
GET [base]/DocumentReference/$docref?patient=123
```

**Request the latest CCD for a patient using POST syntax**

```
POST [base]/DocumentReference/$docref
```
POST request body:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "id": "get-ccd123",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "patient",
      "valueId": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Request Discharge Summaries for 2019 using GET syntax**

```
GET [base]/DocumentReference/$docref?patient=123&start=2019-01-01&end=2019-12-31&type=https://loinc.org|18842-5
```

**Request Discharge Summaries for 2019 using POST syntax**

```
POST [base]/DocumentReference/$docref
```
POST request body:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "id": "get-docs",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "patient",

    },
    {
      "name": "start",
      "valueDateTime": "2019-01-01"
    },
    {
      "name": "end",

      "valueCoding": {
        "system": "https://loinc.org",
        "code": "18842-5",
        "display": "Discharge summary"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## `$expand` operation
The [$expand operation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-operation-expand.html), as defined as part of US Core 6.1.0, is used to determine the values in a ValueSet.  

### `$expand` parameters
|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|url|Canonical reference of the value set.|
| valueSet| Provide the value set directly as part of the request.|

Note: other $expand parameters beyond this list aren't currently supported.

### Example `$expand` requests

**Expanding a value set by its canonical URL using GET syntax**

```
GET [base]/ValueSet/$expand?url=http://acme.com/fhir/ValueSet/23
```

**Expanding a value set by its canonical URL using POST syntax**

```
POST [base]/ValueSet/$expand
```
POST request body:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "id": "expand",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "url",
      "value": "http://acme.com/fhir/ValueSet/23"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expanding a value set already registered on the server using GET syntax**

```
GET [base]/ValueSet/23/$expand
```

**Expanding a value set in the parameters using POST syntax**

```
POST [base]/ValueSet/$expand
```
POST request body:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "id": "expand",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "valueSet",
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ValueSet",
        <value set details>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
